Black Hippy Website
This website is one which allows users to learn information about Black Hippy with relation to their discography, music and history in addition to allowing them to book and get a chance to interact with them via a booking page. It appeals to current fans in that it allows them to view media relating to the group permitting them to listen to their favourite songs and save pictures to use for backgrounds. It also appeals to new fans in that it highlights the best qualities of the group, gives them information with relation to the group in addition to giving them a chance to hear the groups music for the first time.
UX
Although the brief suggested using ‘The Monkees’ as the band for the website, I decided to use the hip-hop rap collective ‘Black Hippy’, due to the fact that I am more familiar with the members, discography and overall style of the group. I felt this decision was beneficial in that it saved me time in doing research on the group to see which colours and styling would be the most suitable for the website in that I already had a very good idea on what was appropriate with regards to what I was trying to convey on each page. 
I wanted my website to serve the purpose of catering to the needs of fans of the group already who wanted to see photos and listen to audio of their favourite group as well as allowing them to book them for an event or special occasion. I also made it for those who were not particularly familiar with the group and wanted to learn more about them. Again, the user had the options to see what the artists looked like via the photos in addition to listening to some of their music on the page to get a better understanding of the musical talents of Black Hippy. In both instances, the needs of the user were at the forefront of my design process and wanted to create a website which would cater to both old and new fans by allowing them to learn more about the group, view their discography, allow them to view photos of the members, listen to their music, and consequently book them for an event.
For the initial planning stage for my project, I decided to undergo extensive research on similar hip hop group websites such as the Wu-Tang-Clan, in addition to actual TDE websites such as the championship tour website, to get an idea of how I should present the layout of each page. I also created a wireframe via detailed sketches on paper as a blueprint on how I wanted the design of the website to look like when it came to developing it online.  I felt more comfortable in doing this than using an online wireframe service as I feel I could better get my ideas down by drawing it and felt more comfortable doing so. 
The next stage of my planning involved me gathering the necessary media I wanted to use for my assets. I already had a vision on how I wanted each page to look and picked my photos and videos accordingly. Again, due to my extensive knowledge of the group, it was not difficult for me to find the appropriate assets to use for my project. After the initial planning stage, the next step was implementing my ideas to the project in a way which would adhere to the ethos of effective UX design principles.
Features
Existing Features
•	A home page where the user can receive some introductory knowledge about the group and what they are about. A video is also available on the home page for the user to view
•	A Discography page going through all studio albums released by individual members of the groups, as well as providing a photo of each artist as well as their name on the first slide of each carousel to allow new fans to be familiar with who is who
•	A Music page where the user can view different songs by the group as well learning the release year of the songs, and allowing them the opportunity to purchase these songs through the external links provided via the ‘purchase’ button.
•	A Photos page acting as a gallery for the user to view pictures, in which, they can click on each individual photo for them to be able to see them enlarged. 
•	A booking page for users to fill out a form in order for them to book Black Hippy for an event of their choosing on a specific day. The page also allows them to book tickets for their “Championship tour”.
Features I wanted to Implement
•	Another feature idea I had and wanted to implement was a ‘Biography’ page going into detail about each member of Black Hippy and their backgrounds, however this idea was scrapped due to it being redundant with the discography page linking the user to the members Wikipedia so that they themselves can read the biography of a member of the group.


Technologies Used
•	Bootstrap 4

I used Bootstrap 4 throughout my project to provide me with templates for things which I feel were imperative to align with good UX design. These components included the carousel sliders on the ‘Albums’ page to view the artist’s discography and the table in the ‘Music’ page detailing the name of the song, year of release, as well as showing the songs themselves.  The form on the ‘Bookings’ page also used code from bootstrap 4 as a template. In essence, these dynamic features of my site were attributed to the implementation of bootstrap 4, speeding up my development process, in addition to facilitating me with a basis in which I was able to develop my ideas, hence why it was one of the most pivotal technologies I used in this project.

•	JQuery
The project used JQuery as part of Bootstrap 4’s third party JavaScript library in order for me to have a collapsible menu for my mobile design. 
•	Font Awesome

I also used to Font Awesome for the icons on my site. Icons of social media, (i.e for Twitter, YouTube etc) are useful with regards to acting as a visual cue of where the user can click to view the social pages of the artists.

•	Google Fonts

I also used Google fonts in this project for aesthetically dynamic text and to provide me with a font which I believe was best suited with relation to the style of the group.
Testing
Throughout the process of developing my website, I ensured that the project worked well and that there were no bugs through extensive testing. My first stages of testing involved me ensuring that all of the links that I had included in my project worked. I made sure I clicked on each link as I included them to ensure that a new tab with the right page would open every time.
I tested out the form on my ‘Bookings’ page by entering both invalid and valid details to the input boxes to ensure that the appropriate messages came on each time. For example, when entering my email address in a different format (not including an ‘@’) a message would appear telling me I have entered incorrect details. This message would also appear when I did not fill in a box and attempted to submit in the form.
I also tested that my site was fully responsive and that it was effective on all devices. I wanted the site to be visually appealing on all devices and because of this it was imperative that my project was designed on the basis of the user being satisfied with the site whether they were using their phone, tablet or laptop. I did this by adding media queries and taking advantage of bootstrap 4’s grid system to make the site more diverse and cater to the needs of the user, depending on what device they were using. For example, on mobile devices, the user is able to see the menu pages of the site by clicking the ‘fa-bars’ icon, which causes a collapsible list which contains the menu of the site, directing the user to each page. This feature is only available with device sizes with 576px width and lower. Devices with a higher width than this simply show the menu items upon the page loading. 

Deployment
With regards to deploying my project to a hosting platform, I did this through GitHub. GitHub allowed me to ensure version control and that I could keep up to date with all the changes I made throughout the development process of my site.
